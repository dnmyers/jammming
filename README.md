# Jammming

Jammming is a React web application that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, and save it to their Spotify account. This project was built to demonstrate my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API.  I created this app for Codecademy's 'Create a Front-End App with React Skill Path'.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Spotify API
- HTTP Requests and Responses
- Authentication

## Project Requirements
- Build a web app using React
- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
- Integrate with Spotify or another API
- Deploy your application
- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project

## Features
- Users can search for songs by song title.
- Users can search by other attributes like artistâ€™s name, genre, etc.
- Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried.
- Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account.

## Future Work
- Improve the UI and add more design elements to make the app more user-friendly.

## Getting Started
To get started with Jammming, clone this repository to your local machine and run the following commands in the terminal:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server. You will also need to obtain a Spotify API key and set the `REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` environment variable with your key. 

## Deployment
To deploy the app, run the command `npm run build` to create a production-ready build of the app. You can then deploy this build to your preferred hosting platform.
